# Ansible installation

## Requirements
- ansible

## Installation

To install the stack, run: ``ansible-playbook site.yml``

The *site.yml* contains the main configuration regarding the roles that are to be installed to the specified hosts.

The hosts are configured in the *hosts* file.

The following roles can be found in the *roles* folder:
- elasticsearch
- logstash
- kibana
- kafka

Each of the roles consists of their own variables (found in the defaults folder), handlers, templates and most importantly their tasks.
Variables that can be used by more than one of the roles are defined in the *group_vars* folder.

## Defaults

### Elasticsearch
```
elastic_key_url: "https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch"
elastic_repo: "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main"
```

### Kibana
```
kibana_server_ip: "localhost"
kibana_server_port: 5601
kibana_user: "kibana"
kibana_password: "kibana"
dashboard_name: aminer.ndjson
dashboard_path: ../dashboards/{{ dashboard_name }}
dashboard_file: "{{ lookup('file', dashboard_path) }}"
```

### Logstash
```
kafka_server_ip: "localhost"
kafka_server_port: 9092
kafka_topics: "aminer" 
input_beats_port: 5044
elasticsearch_host: "http://localhost:9200"
```

### Kafka
```
kafka_base_url: http://www-eu.apache.org/dist/kafka
kafka_version: 2.5.0
kafka_scala_version: 2.12
kafka_root_dir: /etc
kafka_dir: "{{ kafka_root_dir }}/kafka"
kafka_listener_protocol: PLAINTEXT
kafka_listener_hostname: "localhost"
kafka_listener_port: 9092
systemd_path: /etc/systemd/system
```

## Examples

### Variables

Kibana server IP and port are configured in *kibana/defaults/main.yml* as follows:

```
kibana_server_ip: "localhost"
kibana_server_port: 5601
```

In the main file of kibana tasks, these variables are used to modify the certain lines in the already existing kibana configuration file that is generated by default on kibana installation.

```
- name: Update kibana server ip
  lineinfile:
    destfile: /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
    regexp: 'server.host:'
    line: 'server.host: {{ kibana_server_ip }}'
```

### Handlers

Handlers are shortcut functions that are defined in the same way as the variables, and are called within tasks when a certain action needs to be performed.

A good example are the systemd services, which are usually enabled and started after the desired package is installed and configured as a service.

In our case, the services of _elasticsearch_, _kibana_ and _logstash_ are automatically enabled and started, but kafka and zookeper are not.

To create the *kafka.service* file (same applies to *zookeeper*) we use templates. There we define the necessary configuration and then push the templates to the _systemd_ path. After that, using the following handlers, we _daemon-reload_ and (re)start the service.

```
- name: restart kafka systemd
  systemd:
    name: kafka
    state: restarted
    daemon_reload: yes
```


## Two notes
 
> The _elastic_key_url_ and _elastic_repo_ can be found in the defaults folder of _elasticsearch_. In case you do not include the elasticsearch role in the *site.yml*, i.e. if you only want to install the other roles, make sure the _elastic key_ and _repo_ are already present in your machine. In this case, they are added via the elasticsearch role, namely in the first four tasks.

> For now, importing the kibana dashboard (ndjson file) is done using the **curl** comand. The recommended ansible way of accessing a REST API using the **uri** module is not working, since it accepts as *Content-Type* only JSON, form-urlencoded or RAW data, whereas for importing the *ndjson* file that contains the AMiner dashboard **multipart-formdata** is needed.


# AMiner in Kibana

## Creating indices

To access AMiner anomalies saved in *elasticsearch* indices must be created. There are two types of AMiner messages: anomalies and info statuses. Their index configuration can be seen in the table below.

| Index  | Time Filter |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| aminer-anomaly*  | @logtimestamp  |
| aminer-statusinfo*  | @fromtimestamp  |

Index configuration can be accessed in **Management > Index Patterns**.

## AMiner dashboard

The AMiner dashboard and its consisting visualizations and indices can be imported via ansible or by importing the **.ndjson** file found in **roles/kibana/dashboards/** directly to Kibana. The import functionality is located at **Management > Saved Objects**.

The AMiner dashboard can then be accessed in the *Dashboard* section of Kibana. Its visualizations can be edited separately in the *Visualize* section.
